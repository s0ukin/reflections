Q1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intialize a repo, it creates the .git file. At that point the directory then becomes a repo. Initializing needs to be done
to generate the file that will eventually become the holder for all metadata.

Q2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area isn't a final location, it is a temporary location that holds the changes that will be made. The working directory
and the repository are both "folders". I think the staging area is valuable because in essence is a summary checklist before
committing.
